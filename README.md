This project was created to practice working with React, it is a webApp similar to IMDB (but much simpler). It was done following Mosh's "Mastering React" course, for the backend we used "vidly-api-node" so if you want to see the whole project working together it would be best to pull that repository as well https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/vidly-api-node. There are some details that I want to work on as well as some styling, but the project is pretty much finished. 

Thanks to this project I have learnt various things:
  - Composing and working with components
  - Understand the use and difference between Props & State
  - Implementing: Pagination, Filtering & Sorting
  - Routing
  - Working with Forms
  - Calling Backend services
  - Authentication & Authorization 
  - Deployment with Heroku & MLab(MongoDB)
